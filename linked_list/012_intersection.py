# Imagine two runners, Alice and Bob, starting on two different tracks
# (linked lists) that may merge at some point. They run at the same speed,
# and when they reach the end of their track, they switch to the start of the otherâ€™s track.
# If the tracks intersect, the runners will meet at the intersection node after covering equal total distances. If there's no intersection, they'll both reach the end (None) at the same time without meeting. This logic ensures detection of the intersection point without using extra space.
