# Approach: Picks a pivot, partitions the array so all smaller elements come before and larger ones after. After partitioning, the pivot is in its correct final position.
#
# Key Observation: After each partition step, the pivot is fixed in its correct place.
#
# Time: Avg O(n log n), Worst O(nÂ²), Space: O(log n)
